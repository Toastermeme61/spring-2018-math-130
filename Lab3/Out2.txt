Enter an integer value with no more than 3 digits: 12
The number 12 divides itself

Enter an integer resistance value between 1 and 1000 ohms: 3
Enter an integer resistance value between 1 and 1000 ohms: 3
Enter an integer resistance value between 1 and 1000 ohms: 2
Enter an integer resistance value between 1 and 1000 ohms: 4
Enter an integer resistance value between 1 and 1000 ohms: 10

To find total resistance we solve the equation for Rt:

1/Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + 1/R4 + 1/R5
1/Rt = 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/10
1/Rt = 1.517
  Rt = 1/1.517
  Rt = 0.659 ohms
